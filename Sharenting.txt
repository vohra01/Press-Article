1.) My query is that what are the dos and dont's of sharenting?

* Make sure you know your privacy levels
Check your privacy controls on your various social media, and consider selecting specific audiences for posts, as well.

Moreover, many social media sites give the option of setting passwords and hiding online content from Google search algorithms. You can also set up a notification that alerts you when your child’s name appears on Google.

* Don’t share partially- or fully-nude photos
Unfortunately, when you post these photos, there is a risk they could get into the wrong hands. At the very least, make sure your profiles are private and if you’re sharing on Facebook, you may even want to create a custom group of people to see these photos.

* Don’t share photos of other people’s kids
Every parent has their own views on sharing photos of their children on social media. Be sure to ask the other parent if you can post a picture of their child before you assume it’s okay.

* Refrain from posting shaming pictures or videos
Don’t share photos or videos of your child getting punished for something they did, or something similar. Shaming violates your child’s trust and may actually their brain development, causing problems for him or her later in life. Public shaming can also make your child a target for bullies at school. What’s more, child predators go online and look for kids with low self-esteem.

* Don’t say where your kids (or their friends) go to school
Unfortunately, this is something we need to be cautious about. Make sure the name and/or defining features of your child’s school don’t show up in the photos you post.

* Give your older children veto power
You may want to give your older children the right to say no to a picture or post. This practice can start as early as four years old.

2.) Parents would love to flaunt their tiny tots or achievements or sporty or brainy teens, where to draw the line?

I do not even want to talk about the dangers of sharing images of children here,
I want to talk about humiliating a child who doesn't even know that these images are being shared of them.
A child who will one day grow up and have these images of them on the internet for all and sundry to discover.
If my mother had shared pictures of me covered in poo as a child and I suddenly discovered it on the internet years later 
would I be best pleased, NO. 
Yes these things are natural, yes they're part and parcel of being a parent,
but they're also private to the child and as someone who is too young to even know what's going on
and it comes down to respect. 
I don't think these types of images should be shared of them or of anyone for that case.

*Thumb rule I suggest is - if I wouldn't like it being shared of me, I don't share it of the children. 

3.) what could be the dangers and how to beat that?

**Consider below mentioned things before you proceed
* Why are we sharing it?
* Would you like if someone else shares it further?
* Would your child appreciate it when he/she grows up?
* What about the predators lurking behind the digital world?
* Would you like these pictures of your kids in diapers as part of his digital footprints when he/she grows up?
