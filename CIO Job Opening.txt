Process Knowledge:
There are many different aspects of defense that may need to be considered, but which are the most important for long-term protection from cyber-criminals and hackers? To setup smooth process following would be needed
1. Firewall
As hacking and cyber-criminals become more sophisticated and defenses become stronger, you might assume that a firewall is obsolete. And while a firewall is arguably the most core of security tools, it remains one of the most important. Its job is to block any unauthorized access to your system.

2. Antivirus Software
If you run a business and do not have a great deal of experience with cybersecurity, you might assume that the terms ‘firewall’ and ‘antivirus’ are synonymous, but they are not. It is necessary to have both a strong firewall and up-to-date antivirus software in place to keep your system secure. In 2018, both remain vital components of your cybersecurity.
3. PKI Services
Many people only associate PKI with SSL or TLS, the technology that encrypts server communications and is responsible for the HTTPS and padlock you see in your browser address bars. While SSL is of course extremely important, not just for security public sites but your internal networks as well, PKI can actually solve a number of common cybersecurity pain points and deserves a place in every organization’s security suite.
In addition to server security, as mentioned above, PKI can be used to:
•	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication and access control
Create compliant, Trusted Digital Signatures
Encrypt email communications and authenticate the sender’s identity.
Digitally sign and protect code.
Build identity and trust into IoT ecosystems

 4. Managed Detection Services
As cyber-criminals and hackers have become more sophisticated, and the techniques and software they use are more advanced, it has become necessary for businesses to invest in more powerful forms of defense. In 2018, it is no longer enough simply to have defenses that react to threats – instead they need to be proactive and identify attacks before they can cause problems.

5. Penetration Testing
Penetration testing is an important way to test your business’ security systems. During a penetration test, cybersecurity professionals will use the same techniques utilized by criminal hackers to check for potential vulnerabilities and areas of weakness. A pen test attempts to simulate the kind of attack a business might face from criminal hackers, including everything from password cracking and code injection to phishing.
6. Staff Training
You might not think of staff training as a ‘tool’ but ultimately, having knowledgeable employees who understand their role in cybersecurity is one of the strongest forms of defense against attacks. There are many training tools that you can invest in to educate staff about best cyber security practices.
